# Technical Architecture

## Backend

EcoFinds uses the integrated backend capabilities of Next.js (API Routes and Server Components). All backend logic runs in a Node.js environment on the server, not in the user's browser.

- **User Management & Synchronization:**
  - Server-side logic in `app/dashboard/page.tsx` securely communicates with Clerk and the database to check for and create new users.
- **Product API (`/api/products`):**
  - **POST:** Securely creates new products, validates data, and links to the authenticated user.
  - **GET:** Fetches products, supports filtering by category and keyword search.
- **Specific Product Management (`/api/products/[productId]`):**
  - **DELETE:** Securely deletes a product, verifying the requester is the owner.
- **Security:** All backend operations use Clerk's `auth()` on the server to ensure only authenticated users can create or delete resources.

## Database

EcoFinds uses **SQLite** (via Prisma ORM) for all data storage. All user and product actions (sign up, add product, view, delete, etc.) are reflected in the `dev.db` file. SQLite was chosen for its speed, zero config, and offline capability‚Äîideal for hackathons.

## ImageKit

- ImageKit is configured (SDK, server utility, credentials in `.env`).
- **Current:** Product forms use a URL string for image placeholders (meets hackathon requirements).
- **Next:** Client-side file upload logic can be added for full image upload support.

## High-Impact Improvisations (Next Steps)

To further impress judges and improve the user experience, consider these:

1. **Toast Notifications:**
   - Add `react-hot-toast` for instant feedback on product creation/deletion.
2. **Edit Product Page:**
   - Implement `/products/[productId]/edit` for full CRUD (pre-filled form, update endpoint).
3. **Loading Skeletons:**
   - Show skeleton cards while loading products for a polished, fast-feeling UI.
4. **Custom Clerk UI Theme:**
   - Match Clerk sign-in/sign-up UI to the app‚Äôs color scheme for seamless branding.
